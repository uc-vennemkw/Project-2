# Project-2
The goal of this script is to display the date and time, but also to pull the systems info and export it to a txt document for the 
user to see. For the output, you will see a string that shows the date and time, along with the time offset from UTC time. It will also show AM or PM. Lastly,
You will see, on your desktop, a "computerinfo.txt" file that will show the computer information in a notepad.

To run this script, you will need to either copy and paste the code into powershell, or, you can copy and paste the code into notepad. 
When you copy into notepad, you can then save the file as a "All files" with a .ps1 extension. After, you can right click the notepad file
and run it in powershell ISE.
